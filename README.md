I worked for almost 10 years in the industry, as a Production Operator. 
Changing the course of my career was a great challenge, but it has allowed me to achieve professional satisfaction. To keep evolving is my greatest professional achievement. 
I believe that with passion and work we can achieve what we dream and do better, not only our lives, but those of those around us. I think we are better when we are together, after all, people need people.
